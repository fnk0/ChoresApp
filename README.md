# Evendar
Events app for the CodeU 2015 summit. This app is a working prototype and will no longer be developed updated.
The codebase has really good examples of integration with different social media sign in providers (Google, Twitter, Facebook), usages of Google Maps + Google Places API and implementantion of the new Design Support Libravy announced during the Google I/O 2015. 

Feel free to copy/paste code from this repo!
